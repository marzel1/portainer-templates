# Portainer Templates

This repository hosts my Portainer **templates.json**.

For more information about the template definition format and how to deploy your own templates, see the [relevant documentation section](https://documentation.portainer.io/v2.0/templates/deploy_stack/).

Each template has an info in the notes when it was added and which was the current Docker version at that date.
